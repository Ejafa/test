Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins who claimed to have played a big part in starting up Facebook and sued CEO Mark Zuckerberg for their share, have now become venture capitalists, announcing their new firm Friday morning on the CNBC show Squawk Box.

They're off to a good start, considering that Winklevoss Capital is presumably financed by the equity they drew from the settlement with Facebook CEO Zuckerberg.

Apparently the Winklevoss twins have polished up their Silicon Valley-esque lingo, uttering such chestnuts as "We focus on early-stage, disruptive startups." Armed with that sort of jargon, what could go wrong?

Could the timing of the launch of Winklevoss Capital have anything to do with the upcoming Facebook IPO, which might happen on May 17? Perhaps the Winklevi are anticipating a big payout for their 1.2 million shares, with which to fund the various ventures they plan to take under their collective wings.
