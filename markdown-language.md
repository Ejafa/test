# Markdown language

this section will discuss on markdown laguage.markdown language is really a wartered down version of markup laguages. I think that's why it's called markdown maybe.

by the way, markdown may be warter downed version of other markup languages like html,xhtml etc. But most amazing fact of markdown language is that it is a superset of markup languages and it supports most of the tags of html language.

## syntax

### 1.paragraph

<code>blank line</code>

### 2.header

headers in markdown are similar to HTML

<code>hash[#] space[ ] text to make header 1</code>

similarly double hash ## for header 2 and so on till header 6

put 1-6 hashes to make header form 1 to 6

### 3. blockquote

<code> >[space] blockquote </code>

> quotes of Albert Einstein 

> Few are those who see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts.

> Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited.Imagination encircles the world.

>Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.

>Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.


>I am by heritage a Jew, by citizenship a Swiss, and by makeup a human being, and only a human being, without any special attachment to any state or national entity whatsoever.

>Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.

>Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.

>Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.

you can also put other syntex to make quote look cool.

<code>>[space]#[space]header 1 text</code>

paragraph in blockquote

<code>>[space] [blankline]</code>

>this is line in blockquote
>
>this is another line after making paragraph but in same blockquote
