# Markdown language

this section will discuss on markdown laguage.markdown language is really a wartered down version of markup laguages. I think that's why it's called markdown maybe.

by the way, markdown may be warter downed version of other markup languages like html,xhtml etc. But most amazing fact of markdown language is that it is a superset of markup languages and it supports most of the tags of html language.

## syntax

### 1.paragraph

blank line

### 2.header

headers in markdown are similar to HTML

hash[#] space[ ] text to make header 1,
similarly double hash ## for header 2 and so on till header 6

put 1-6 hashes to make header form 1 to 6
